As of REL_2 UbixOS is now using the UFS/FFS filesystem.. UbixFS is currently depreciated..



Installation:

  make all install <- This will build the kernel and components and put them onto a floppy

  Do the following if and only if your boot disk is not bootable and you just need to do 
  it once

  To make a bootable floppy do the following:
    1) cd src/sys/boot/btx;make
    2) cd ../boot2;make
    3) cat boot1 boot2 > /dev/fd0
    4) gcc -o test test.c;./test /dev/fd0 1;rm ./test
