UbixOS VM -
Preconfigured System To Run UbixOS
Has RDP enabled on 3389 so you can see the desktop and launch with VBoxHeadless -s UbixOS

UbixOS has a 2GB drive that is a shared drive so it can be used live in the UbixOS VM and the MrOlsen VM


MrOlsen-BSD VM -
Preconfigured System To Build UbixOS
Has SSHD enabled and is on DHCP so you can launch with VBoxHeadless -s MrOlsen-BSD

MrOlsen-BSD has the UbixOS.vdi attached and mapped at /ubixos


BUILD -

To build ubixos ssh in 

username your username
password your passwod

su (root password)

cd /ubixos/usr/src

make;sync (that simple will compile everything and automatically copy to the right spaces)

Press alt-c in the RDP for the UbixOS vm and it will reboot UbixOS VM (only reboot for kernel changes)


NOTES -

Now using git, when you want to get any changes from the MASTER in /ubixos/usr/src type git pull

If you made changes you have to type git commit -a (the -a auto tracks files)
If you create a new file you need to git add [filename] (this add a new file ex. git add ./src/kernel/kern_stuff.c) then git commit -a

To push your changes to the MASTER for me and the rest of the devs to get you need to type git push.. Please make everything compiles before doing a git push
